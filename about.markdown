I am currently a Software Engineer at a [satellite communication startup](https://rbcsignals.com/). Most of my work is on the software development and mission operations teams.

I became interested in satellite communications working as an undergraduate research assistant under the mentorship of Dr. Whitney Lohmeyer. During this time I published [four papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_works&gmla=AETOMgFPr1zKNTvL9A4lsXvrEJDX3GDx7lzzr6Rl2tWL_7zdBoccZ5eNUtP0FUU38SHsiYLWqXQFFUjVTEo3e77UYlBN&user=UhDMLdgAAAAJ) on various topics in satellite communications and space policy and led the ground station team for the SWARM-EX cubesat mission.

I studied applied math in undergrad. Some of my favorite classes were Abstract Algebra, Number Theory, and Real Analysis. I took some applied math classes where I built the following projects: [satellite image compression using the SVD and convolutional autoencoders](https://github.com/zaynpatel/MatrixMethods), [hamming codes in hardware](https://github.com/olincollege/HammingCodeHardware), [latent semantic analysis](https://github.com/zaynpatel/LTA2061). I also gave talks on [linear regression from scratch](https://github.com/zaynpatel/TAAS/tree/main/Deliverable_1) and [matrix calculus](https://github.com/zaynpatel/TAAS/tree/main/Deliverable_3).
